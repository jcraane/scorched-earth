In "Scorched Earth," players can earn money primarily by successfully hitting and destroying opponents' tanks. Here's a more detailed breakdown of how players can accumulate money in the game:


Destroying Opponents:
The primary way to earn money is by successfully hitting and destroying enemy tanks. Each tank destroyed typically awards the player a certain amount of money. The more opponents you defeat, the more money you earn.
Surviving Rounds:
Players who survive a round may earn a monetary bonus. The amount can depend on the number of opponents defeated and the player's performance during the round.
Interest:
At the end of each round, players earn interest on their remaining cash balance. The interest rate can be set in the game's configuration options, and it serves as an incentive to save money between rounds.
